A database of my favorite recipes, searchable by tags.

you can make a simple HTTP server that just serves up premade JSON recipes until you get to a database

also lowdb and sql-lite are pretty easy to use databases
Assuming lowdb has good docs

You'd npm install it
Require it
Then use it based on the docs
